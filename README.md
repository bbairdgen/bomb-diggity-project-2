# Autocorrect Anonymous

## Description

Autocorrect Anonymous is a database with a front end for storing information to be used by an auto-correcter/text-replacer. We built this with the motivation that it would be useful for us to build our own text-replacement apps or use existing ones as a way to store the data to be accessed mobily and shared with others. In the process we learned how to make a full-stack application that takes input from any user to update its database.
